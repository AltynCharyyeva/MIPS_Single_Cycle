# MIPS Single Cycle Processor
This project implements a MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) Single Cycle Processor in VHDL (Hardware Description Language). The MIPS architecture is widely used for teaching and 
research purposes due to its simplicity and efficiency.

# Features:
- Single Cycle Execution: Each instruction completes in a single clock cycle.
- Support for MIPS Instruction Set: Implements a subset MIPS instructions.
- Basic Components: Includes essential components such as ALU, Control unit, Register File, and Memory unit, all described in VHDL.
- Testing: Was tested on FPGA board


# Getting Started:
- Clone Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Setup Environment: Ensure you have a VHDL development environment set up, such as Xilinx Vivado, connect the FPGA board and set up the configurations
- Compile and Run
The ROM.vhdl file in the project contains a small program, namely calculating the sum of the elements in the array, see the program execution.
